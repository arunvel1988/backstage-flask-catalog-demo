## **4️⃣ Register & Build Docs**

1. Commit your `docs/` folder and updated `catalog-info.yaml` to GitHub.  
2. Go to **Backstage → Catalog → Your Service → TechDocs tab**.  
3. Click **“Regenerate Docs”** (if using TechDocs backend) → TechDocs will fetch the Markdown and render it in Backstage.  

---

✅ **Summary of Fix**

- Add `backstage.io/techdocs-ref` annotation.  
- Create a `docs/` folder with `index.md` in your repo.  
- Commit changes → Backstage will render TechDocs correctly.

If you want, I can **write a full working `catalog-info.yaml` + sample docs folder** ready for your Flask demo so you can just push it to GitHub and see TechDocs working immediately.  

Do you want me to do that?
